# About me

I am a recent graduate who has decided to pursue a career in manual software testing. I am keenly interested in the IT
sector and am eager to acquire new skills to advance my expertise in this field. My background in laboratory work has
honed my attention to detail and analytical thinking abilities, enabling me to identify and address software
issues with accuracy effectively.

Currently, I am intensively studying QA techniques and tools by attending online courses and testing web applications
created for learning purposes.

I want to gain experience as a manual software tester and cultivate my competencies in the IT sector. In the future, I would
like to associate my professional growth with test automation through programming languages.

In this repository, I would like to show you my qualifications, projects, and everything I have gained from my personal
studies and research.
