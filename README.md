# About me

I have a strong foundation in manual software testing, backed by hands-on commercial experience in the IT sector. My journey in quality assurance has refined my attention to detail, analytical thinking, and problem-solving skills, enabling me to identify software issues efficiently.

I actively utilize a variety of testing techniques, including exploratory testing, regression testing, and functional testing, to ensure software quality meets the highest standards. Currently, I am expanding my expertise by delving into advanced QA methodologies and tools, with a particular focus on transitioning towards test automation.

My future career aspirations lie in developing robust automation frameworks using Java and Selenium. I am enthusiastic about bridging the gap between manual and automated testing to enhance efficiency and reliability in software development cycles.
